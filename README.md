GraphQL is revolutionizing how we develop and build websites. Seen as an alternative to REST APIs, this query language has become popular among developers and engineers who are looking for a tool to quickly develop and deploy applications and features with minimal fuss.

Starting with the basics, this book will teach you how to set up GraphQL and key details regarding queries and mutations before moving on to more advanced, practical topics and projects.

You will gain a comprehensive understanding of the full web development ecosystem, from front end to back end, by learning to build React applications using Prisma, Apollo Client, and MongoDB. Using a project-based approach, this book will equip you with all the practical knowledge needed to tackle full enterprise projects and turbocharge your skills.
